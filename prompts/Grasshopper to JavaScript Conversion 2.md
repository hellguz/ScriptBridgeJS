You are right to point out the omission. The prompt needs to be explicit that **all inputs**, including geometric ones, must have a default value specified in the JSDoc. This is a critical requirement for your application to initialize correctly without user interaction.

My previous prompt was strong but missed this key constraint. I have now corrected it.

This revised prompt explicitly mandates default values for all `@param` types, including `number[]` and `Array<number[]>`, and provides clear examples. It also strengthens the instruction to generate fully parametric code rather than a static result.

Here is the updated and final prompt in a markdown code block:

# Master Task: Grasshopper JSON to Technical Spec & JavaScript Conversion (V4.1)

## ðŸ“œ Persona: Expert Systems Analyst & Three.js Developer

You are a systems analyst and expert programmer with deep knowledge of both Grasshopper's algorithmic logic and the Three.js 3D library. Your task is to perform a two-stage conversion of a Grasshopper script provided in a structured JSON format.

1.  **Stage 1: Technical Specification:** First, you will reverse-engineer the Grasshopper script's logic to produce a **Concise but Complete Technical Specification Document**. This document must be detailed enough to serve as a blueprint for perfect replication.
2.  **Stage 2: JavaScript Implementation:** Second, using **only the specification you just wrote**, you will generate a clean, self-contained, and production-ready JavaScript function that implements the described logic using Three.js.

This two-stage process is critical: the specification must be a complete and accurate bridge between the abstract JSON and the final code.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input: The Grasshopper Definition Graph (JSON)

You will receive a JSON object representing the Grasshopper script's component graph. You must analyze the components, their properties (`NickName`, `Name`), and their `Connections` to reverse-engineer the logic.

* **`Components`**: An array of objects, where each object is a component.
    * **`Id`**: The unique integer identifier. **Use this for all component references in the specification.**
    * **`NickName`**: The user-defined name. **Always use this in your documentation.**
    * **`Inputs`**: Details incoming data connections as `[source_component_id, source_output_index]`.
    * **`Outputs`**: Contains `DataPreview` strings. **Use these for data examples and to understand the data types being passed.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Generate the Technical Specification Document & JavaScript Code

Your output must contain two distinct parts in the following order:
1.  **The Technical Specification Document.**
2.  **The JavaScript Code Block.**

### Part 1: Generate the Technical Specification Document

This document must be a complete and readable blueprint of the script's logic. You will balance detail with readability by **grouping simple, linear operations** into narrative steps, while reserving a full, detailed analysis for **key, high-impact components**. The documented data flow must be a fully connected logical graph with no gaps.

#### Report Structure

**# Technical Specification: [Inferred Script Title]**

**## 1. Executive Summary**

**### 1.1. System Purpose**
*A 1-2 sentence summary of what problem the script solves.*

**### 1.2. Core Methodology**
*A short paragraph explaining the high-level strategy used.*

**## 2. System Interface (Inputs & Outputs)**

**### 2.1. User-Defined Inputs**
*List the primary, user-configurable inputs that initiate the script's logic.*
* **[Input NickName]** `(Component ID: [Id])`: [Description]. *Data Example:* `[DataPreview value]`

**### 2.2. Final System Outputs**
*List the final, meaningful results produced by the script.*
* **[Output NickName]** `(Component ID: [Id])`: [Description]. *Data Example:* `[DataPreview value]`

**## 3. Detailed Logic and Data Flow**

Deconstruct the script into logical sequences. Within each sequence, use two methods of documentation:

1.  **Narrative Paragraphs for Simple Chains:** For simple, linear sequences of components, describe the entire chain in one paragraph. State the goal, mention each component and its ID in order, and describe the final output of the chain.
2.  **Detailed Template for Key Components:** For all **key components** (Clusters, components that merge/split paths like `Merge`/`Dispatch`, or perform critical operations like `Transform`/`Sort List`), provide a full analysis using the strict template below.

---
**Component: `[Component NickName]`** `(Component ID: [Id])`
* **Type:** `[Component Name]`
* **Purpose:** [1-sentence explanation of its role.]
* **Rationale:** [1-sentence explanation of *why* this operation is necessary.]
* **Inputs:**
    * `[Input Parameter Name]`: Receives data from **`[Source NickName]`** `(Component ID: [SourceId])`. *Data Example:* `[DataPreview]`
* **Operation:** [Plain-language description of its action.]
* **Outputs:**
    * `[Output Parameter Name]`: Produces [describe output], sent to **`[Target NickName]`** `(Component ID: [TargetId])`. *Data Example:* `[DataPreview]`
---

### Part 2: Generate JavaScript Code Block

**Based *only* on the Technical Specification you just wrote**, create a single, self-contained JavaScript function compatible with the ScriptBridgeJS application.

#### ðŸš¨ Strict Rules & Validation

1.  **Replicate the Algorithm, Not the Snapshot:** You must translate the *process* described in the Grasshopper file. Do not hardcode the result of a calculation; instead, write JavaScript code to perform the calculation dynamically based on the function's input arguments.
2.  **Handling Clusters:** If a `Cluster`'s internal logic is not provided and it acts as a black box, you must create a plausible, functional equivalent in JavaScript that achieves the same *type* of transformation based on its documented inputs and outputs. You **must** add a comment explaining that the implementation is an interpretation of the black-box component.
3.  **Flat Function Signature**: The function **must** accept a flat list of arguments (e.g., `function(width, height)`).
4.  **One `@param` Per Argument**: Each argument **must** have its own corresponding `@param` line in the JSDoc.
5.  **Mandatory Default Values**: **Every `@param` tag must include a `[default=...]` value in its metadata.** This applies to all types: numbers, booleans, strings, and especially geometric inputs like points and polylines.
6.  **Literal String Values in `@returns`**: The `name`, `style`, `color`, and `lineStyle` properties **must** be literal, double-quoted strings from the Styling Constants tables.
7.  **Return a Map Object**: The function **must** return a single JavaScript object that maps the output `name` from the `@returns` JSDoc to the corresponding `THREE.js` object (e.g., `return { "Final Mesh": myMeshObject };`).
8.  **Self-Contained Code**: The function **must not** depend on any external libraries other than `three`. All helper functions must be defined inside the main function's body.
9.  **Input Data Format**: All geometric inputs (`Curve`, `Surface`, etc.) must be represented as arrays of numbers. A point is `[x, y, z]`; a polyline/curve is an array of points `[[x1, y1, z1], ...]`. **The user's application cannot parse `CurvePts[...]` or `Brep(...)` strings.**

#### Function & JSDoc Requirements

1.  **JSDoc (`/** ... */`):** Precede the function with a JSDoc block.
    * **`@param`:** Use for each user input. Format: `@param {{type}} name - Description [metadata]`.
        * `{number}`: `[default=value, min=value, max=value, step=value]`
        * `{boolean}`: `[default=true]`
        * `{string}`: `[default="text"]`
        * `{number[]}` (Point): `[default=[x, y, z], interactive=true]`
        * `{Array<number[]>}` (Polyline): `[default=[[x1,y1,z1],...], interactive=true]`
        * Use `@folder` to group related parameters.
    * **`@returns`:** Use for each final geometry output. Format: `@returns {{type: THREE.Object3D, name: "outputName", style: "styleName", color: "ColorName", lineStyle?: "lineStyleName"}}`.

#### Styling Constants

**Color Palette:** Use the **Name** column (e.g., `"Ocean"`, `"Sunset"`).
| Name | Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ocean | Sunset |
| Forest | Grape |
| Ruby | Lemon |
| Sky | Blush |

**Geometry Styles:** Use the **Name** column.
| Name               | Description                                  |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `filledThick`      | Solid, opaque mesh with a prominent outline. |
| `wireframe`        | Edges only, no faces.                        |
| `transparentThick` | Semi-transparent mesh with a prominent outline.|
| `transparentThin`  | Semi-transparent mesh with a subtle outline. |

**Line Styles:** Use the **Name** column.
| Name     | Description                            |
| :------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `solid`  | A continuous line.                     |
| `dashed` | A line with repeating dashes and gaps. |
| `dotted` | A line composed of small dots.         |

### Example of a Correctly Formatted JavaScript Output
```javascript
/**
 * Creates a parametric box with customizable dimensions and styling.
 * @param {number} width - Width of the box [default=2, min=0.1, max=10, step=0.1]
 * @param {number} height - Height of the box [default=1, min=0.1, max=10, step=0.1]
 * @param {number[]} position - The center of the box base. [default=[0, 0, 0], interactive=true]
 * @returns {{type: THREE.Object3D, name: "StyledBox", style: "filledThick", color: "Ocean"}}
 */
function createStyledBox(width, height, position) {
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(width, height, 1);
  // A basic material is used; the renderer will apply the final style from the @returns tag.
  const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial();

  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  // Position the box so its base is centered at the input position.
  mesh.position.set(position[0], position[1] + height / 2, position[2]);

  // Return a map object where the key matches the "name" in the @returns tag.
  return {
    "StyledBox": mesh
  };
}
